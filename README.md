# Flight Trajectory Monitoring Dashboard

## Project Overview

You will be simulating a real-world scenario to develop a user interface for a flight trajectory monitoring system for Air Space Intelligence. This project will involve designing and implementing a dashboard that visualizes high-density geospatial information related to air traffic. Your final product should demonstrate your proficiency in TypeScript, React, CSS, Unit Testing, and Redux.

## Tasks

1. Research existing solutions for flight trajectory visualization.
2. Define the data points you will need to display.
3. Create wireframes for the dashboard focusing on user-friendly navigation.
4. Highlight key features such as map integration, flight data overview, and filtering options.
